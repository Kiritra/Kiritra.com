# Add wings to your digital aspirations

## Kiritra
Kiritra (or Khiritra) is a Greek word for honeycomb. Just like each cell of the honeycomb provides valuable nectar, each of our services provide business value for banks and non-banking financial institutions. At Kiritra we build cloud native micro services to enable the digital transformation of organizations without the cumbersome process of identifying the technology and building the platform from ground up. We provide the technology, the business knowhow as well as the ability to develop and deploy a cloud enabled digital strategy.
