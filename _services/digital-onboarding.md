COVID-19 pandemic has changed the fundamentals of customer on-boarding for ever in positive way. Till recently this was largely a manual and offline process involving in-person meetings, exchanging of documents and forms. However with RBI approving the videoKYC, on-boarding can be accomplished by the customers without ever having to step out of their homes and at a fraction of cost to the enterprise.

Not just financial services institutions but enterprises that on-boards individuals like telecoms, utility service providers, real estate provider etc can use this service.
